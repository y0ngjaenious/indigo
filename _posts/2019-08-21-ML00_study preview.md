# Study Preview

It's just over a year since I started studying about data science. When I just began, I studied with this book, **JAMES, Gareth, et al. *An introduction to statistical learning*.  springer, 2013.**

After this, I wanted to determine my research interests. So I tried to understand several topics. I studied about 1) computer vision with *CS231n, Stanford*, 2) overall deep learning with *Ian Goodfellow, Deep Learning*, 3) stochastic process. Plus, I took several lectures for improving my background in statistics, linear algebra,  and for enhancing programming skills.

Finally, I think I'm really interested in statistical learning and its various application. Thus, I want to study deeper about Statistical Machine Learning and summarize on my Github page.

## Study Reference

The main reference is **Christopher Bishop, *Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning.* Springer 2007.**

But my summary does not strictly follow the order of the textbook.

I will also reference the following books & lectures to further extend the depth and breadth of my knowledge of statistical machine learning.

- Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman, The Elements of Statistical Learning. Springer 2008.
- IIE661, I.C. Moon. KAIST
- Bayesian Deep Learning, S.J. Choi., Edwith
